            <h3>Tire Lifter & Alignment</h3>

            <h1>Background</h1>

            <p>In the automotive industry, the efficiency and safety of tire maintenance operations are critical factors influencing workshop productivity. 
            Traditional tire lifts, such as the Martins Industries Electric Tire Lift, require manual intervention for processes like aligning the lug holes, 
            which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recognizing this, the project aims to develop an innovative tire lift and alignment machine that 
            automates the crucial steps of lifting and aligning car, SUV, and pickup tires. By integrating pneumatic technology and programmable logic control 
            (PLC), the design offers a streamlined solution to reduce the physical effort involved in tire changes while improving speed and accuracy. The machine's
            versatility across different wheel and tire sizes and its ability to accommodate varying bolt patterns ensures broad applicability within automotive workshops.</p>

            <h1>Execution</h1>

            <p>The design process commenced with an analysis of mechanical, pneumatic, electrical, and control system components. 
            Fusion360 was employed to model the machine's structure, ensuring an optimized frame for stability and durability. 
            Stress analysis was conducted in SolidWorks to verify the material selection could withstand operational loads. Pneumatic design, 
            handled in FluidSim 6, focused on utilizing Festo DSNU pneumatic cylinders operating at 90 psi, providing reliable and consistent movement for tire lifting.
            
            </p>
            
            <p>For automation and control, the Allen-Bradley Micrologix 1400 PLC was selected to manage tire alignment and lifting operations. 
            Safety features, such as emergency stop buttons and OSHA-compliant interlocks, were incorporated to ensure operator safety throughout the process. 
            The ladder logic for PLC control was developed in PLCFiddle, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI) was designed to offer easy interaction for operators. 
            Testing confirmed the system's ability to lift and align tires of various sizes with minimal manual effort, marking a successful execution of the tire lift 
            and alignment machine's objectives.</p>
