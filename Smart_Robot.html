            <h3>Automated Smart Robot Car</h3>

            <h1>Background</h1>

            <p>The project tasked the group with constructing a Smart Robot Car capable of completing two key tasks. 
            Using the ELEGOO UNO R3 Smart Robot Car kit, the students demonstrated their knowledge of microprocessors 
            and their ability to integrate hardware with software, all programmed in the Arduino IDE. The first task 
            involved designing the car to follow a line autonomously, utilizing infrared (IR) sensors to detect a 
            dark-colored tape on the ground, which acted as a guide. The second task required the car to navigate 
            through a maze using ultrasonic sensors, which emitted pulses and calculated the time delay between sending
            and receiving the signal to determine proximity to objects, enabling the car to turn and avoid obstacles. 
            The project's overall objective was to test the students' mastery in integrating sensor-based systems, 
            real-time data processing, and automated navigation.</p>

            <h1>Execution</h1>

            <p>The Smart Robot Car was assembled using the provided kit, and coding was done in the Arduino IDE. 
            The line-following task required the car to move from Point A to Point B along a black tape, stopping 
            for 3 seconds once it reached the endpoint. The IR sensors detected the line and guided the car's movement. 
            The maze portion involved more complex navigation. Here, ultrasonic sensors were crucial, sending out pulses 
            that bounced back from obstacles to calculate distances, helping the car avoid collisions as it made its way 
            through the maze. After completing both tasks, the car was required to stop at the exit of the maze. 
            Additional challenges included ensuring the car completed the maze within a time limit and without colliding with walls, 
            as these factors impacted the final grade. The bonus challenge required the car to successfully navigate a randomly 
            configured maze, testing the robustness of the code and sensor integration without any adjustments allowed.</p>

            <h1>Results</h1>

            <p>The robot successfully completed the maze, as demonstrated in the video. Using its ultrasonic sensors, 
            the robot efficiently navigated through the maze, avoiding obstacles and making precise turns without any collisions. 
            The sensor-based guidance allowed it to reach the exit ramp, meeting the project's requirements for autonomous navigation 
            and obstacle avoidance. The seamless execution highlights the effectiveness of the coding and sensor integration, 
            showcasing the robot's ability to complete the task as designed.</p>
