            <h3>Gantry Crane PID Control</h3>

            <h1>Background</h1>

            <p>The gantry crane system, commonly employed in construction for transporting heavy loads, 
            presents unique control challenges due to the dynamic behavior of its payload. As the crane 
            moves along its horizontal track, the swinging motion of the load must be carefully controlled 
            to avoid accidents and inefficiencies. Minimizing the swing angle and ensuring a smooth transfer 
            in the shortest time possible is crucial for operational safety and efficiency. In control systems, 
            closed-loop controllers are often preferred for such tasks due to their ability to correct system errors, 
            reduce disturbances, and ensure stable performance. In this project, the focus is on modeling and simulating 
            the gantry crane system using MATLAB and Simulink to design an effective control system that can manage the crane's 
            motion efficiently.</p>

            <h1>Execution</h1>

            <p>The execution of this project involved designing and analyzing control strategies using two approaches: root-locus and frequency response techniques. 
            In Simulink, the system's equations of motion were modeled, and various simulations were conducted to evaluate the system’s response. Using the root-locus method, 
            the team iteratively adjusted the system's gain to meet steady-state error and transient response requirements. The frequency response approach, which is more direct, 
            was also employed to fine-tune the controller. MATLAB's SISOTOOL facilitated the control system design, allowing for a systematic analysis of the system's stability 
            and performance. By applying these techniques, the desired control objectives, such as minimizing overshoot and improving settling time, were achieved. </p>

            <h1>Results</h1>

            </div>            
            <p>The step response shows that the system reacts quickly but has some oscillations, peaking at 0.0807 before settling down after 0.696 seconds. 
            Although there is some overshoot, it indicates the system is responsive, which can be a good trait for performance.
            
            </p>

            <p>The Bode diagram shows that the system amplifies signals around 1 rad/s, which might help it respond better to certain inputs. 
            The phase shift suggests that as the frequency increases, the system's behavior changes, but overall, it remains stable.
        
            </p>
                
            <p>In conclusion, both responses indicate that the system performs well, with quick reactions and good stability, suggesting it is suitable for the project's needs.</p>
