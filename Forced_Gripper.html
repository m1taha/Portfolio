            <h3>Forced Gripper using LabVIEW</h3>

            <h1>Background</h1>

            <p>The development of a force-controlled gripper system exemplifies the integration of advanced technologies for 
            precise object manipulation. This project focused on creating a robotic hand capable of delicately handling lightweight objects, 
            specifically a ping pong ball. Utilizing a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system, a strain gauge load cell, and a stepper motor, 
            the project aimed to achieve accurate force measurements and controlled movements. The load cell served as the key sensor, 
            converting mechanical force into electrical signals, allowing for the precise monitoring of grip strength. In parallel, a stepper 
            motor was selected for its ability to provide fine control over the gripper's movements, ensuring gentle handling of delicate items. 
            The system was controlled via LabVIEW, implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop control algorithm to enhance 
            responsiveness and accuracy. This approach highlights the seamless collaboration between hardware and software components, showcasing 
            the potential of robotic systems in applications requiring meticulous handling of fragile objects.</p>

            <h1>Execution</h1>

            <p>The execution of this project involved a systematic approach to design, calibration, and implementation of the force-controlled gripper.

            </p>
            <p>1. Mechanical Design: The mechanical framework was crafted to effectively grip a ping pong ball. This design involved connecting a 
                stepper motor to a gear system that controlled two arms. The load cell was strategically mounted to measure the force applied when 
                the arms closed around the ball. The final assembly comprised a 3D-printed part for the gripper and wooden components for the base and arms, 
                along with commonly available gears and screws.
            
            </p>
            <p> 2. Electrical System & Data Acquisition: The electrical architecture incorporated essential components including the load cell, 
                operational amplifiers (NE5532), and a USB DAQ system (NI 6001). The load cell operated by converting mechanical deflection into resistance changes, 
                which were then amplified using the NE5532 to ensure accurate force readings. The DAQ system facilitated the conversion of analog signals from the 
                load cell into digital formats for processing.
            
            </p>
            <p> 3. Sensor Calibration and Data Logging: The calibration process was essential to ensure precise force measurements. 
                A known weight was applied to the load cell to derive a conversion factor, and a Python function was utilized for signal filtering. 
                LabVIEW was employed for data logging, capturing both raw and compensated force values for subsequent analysis.
            
            </p>
            <p> 4. Control System Implementation: The PID control algorithm was implemented in LabVIEW, using the compensated force as the process variable. 
                The output of the PID controller was converted into commands for the stepper motor, determining the direction and speed based on the control signals. 
                This integration ensured that the gripper could delicately manipulate objects while adhering to predefined force limits.
            
            </p>    
            <p> 5.Performance Assessment: Throughout the execution phase, performance was rigorously assessed. Detailed graphs were generated to evaluate the system's 
                responsiveness and accuracy, with a focus on maintaining the delicate balance between grip strength and object integrity. The successful manipulation of 
                the ping pong ball underscored the effectiveness of the combined hardware and software systems in achieving the project goals.

            <p>As demonstrated in the video, the force-controlled gripper successfully manipulated the ping pong ball by effectively utilizing the strain gauge load cell 
            for precise force measurement and a stepper motor for controlled movement. The PID control algorithm implemented in LabVIEW ensured real-time adjustments to 
            the motor commands, allowing the gripper to securely hold the ball without causing any damage. This successful demonstration highlights the system's capability 
            to handle delicate objects with precision and care.</p>
