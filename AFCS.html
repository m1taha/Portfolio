            <h3>Automated Furniture Cleaning Station</h3>

            <h1>Background</h1>

            <p>Approached by a Vaughan-based furniture manufacturer for the capstone project to design an automated cleaning station 
            aimed at addressing inefficiencies and health hazards in their manual cleaning process. The current method was labor-intensive and
            involved harmful cleaning chemicals, posing risks to worker safety and productivity. To solve this, our project focused on 
            developing an automated system that would not only streamline cleaning operations but also promote environmental responsibility 
            by incorporating eco-friendly cleaning agents.</p>

            <h1>Execution</h1>

            <p>The project began with a thorough study of existing automated cleaning technologies, such as car wash systems, 
            to tailor a solution suitable for furniture cleaning. SolidWorks was used to create a detailed 3D model of the station, 
            optimizing the design to fit various furniture sizes, while ensuring compatibility with the client's operational constraints. 
            Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was then employed to ensure structural durability under operational loads.

            The cleaning station incorporated a Siemens PLC system for precise control and automation, combined with photosensitive sensors
            that enabled adaptive cleaning based on the dimensions of the furniture. The use of pneumatic systems allowed smooth and accurate
            movement during the cleaning process. Goo-Gone, an eco-friendly cleaning agent, was selected as a safer alternative to hazardous chemicals. 
            Field testing confirmed the system's ability to reduce manual labor, improve safety, and meet the desired operational efficiency.</p>
